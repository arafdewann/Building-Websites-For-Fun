In this project, I enhanced my web development skills by creating a Spider-Man movie website. I utilized HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling, including custom styles and Bootstrap for responsive design. I learned to integrate Google Fonts for improved typography and applied gradient backgrounds for visual appeal. Handling media elements, I embedded images, a YouTube video, and a SoundCloud audio player. Ensuring uniform image display, I used CSS properties like `object-fit` and `height`. I also explored JavaScript libraries for interactive elements. Additionally, I practiced writing clean, modular code and learned to include metadata for better SEO. This project helped me understand the importance of responsive design, accessibility, and user experience in web development.
